Description: A collection of analytic tools in R. I have
    accumulated a suite of functions that help me quickly
    produce results, tables and charts that I find useful for
    analyzing high-throughput data, including microarray and
    next-generation-sequencing. It also allows for easy
    reproducibility and collaboration both within the MD Anderson
    Cancer Center (MDACC) and with the broader community.
