Description: A accumulated suite of functions in R that was designed
    to help produce results, tables and charts quickly for analyzing
    high-throughput data, including microarray and
    next-generation-sequencing (NGS). It also allows for easy
    reproducibility and collaboration both within the MD Anderson
    Cancer Center (MDACC) and with the broader community.
